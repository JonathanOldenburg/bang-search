# ðŸ”Ž Bang Search Redirector

I started watching this video [i made my own search engine (kind of)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DnNzRaBWUU&t=737s), where he builds a similar webpage to use in any browser. Then I challenge myself to build the same concept using github pages.

## How to Use

### Add as Custom Search Engine

1. Go to your browser's **Search Engine Settings**.
2. Add a new search engine:
   - **Name:** Bang Search
   - **Keyword:** `!` (or any you like)
   - **URL:**
     ```
     https://bang-search.jonathanoldenburg.github.io?q=%s
     ```

---

### How to Search

Just use your query followed by a **bang code** (a `!` plus a letter).
Example:

```
how to train a falcon !g
```

This redirects you to Google with the search `"how to train a falcon"`.

## Isn't there better options(built in funcionallity or browser extensions)?

Yes! but this project was just meant to have fun and a little challenge
