# Bang-search
A simple web page that works like DuckDuckGo bang search, taking parameters from url and redirecting the user

## Why
I started watching this video [i made my own search engine (kind of)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DnNzRaBWUU&t=737s), where he builds a similar webpage to use in any browser. Then I challenge myself to build the same concept using github pages.

## Usage

### Set up
Just add a new custom search engine in your browser with the url https://bang-search.jonathanoldenburg.github.io?q=%s.

To configure the default search engine, just access https://bang-search.jonathanoldenburg.github.io, and set the default engine through UI.
